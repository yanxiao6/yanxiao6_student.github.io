I am now a Research Fellow in [SoC, National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), Master and Bachelor degree in Computer and Information from [Hohai University](http://www.hhu.edu.cn/). My research is within the domain of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence in application domains related to software bug localization, software code readability, software integration test, data mining, and big data analysis. My researches are undertaken in a broad spectrum of application domains, such as self-driving cars, deep neural network analysis, and hydrological data analysis. I now focus on:
1. trustworthiness evaluation for autonomous driving.
1. deep neural network repair for improving the accuracy of models.
1. adversarial test generation for deep learning systems.
